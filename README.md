# Hello-World
Getting started!
I'm new to this amazing site - Github! 
I have MSc in electrical engineering and for the past two years I have developed much interest in data.
My heart beats now towards data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
I have learned a lot already from the contributions from the great minds on Github and I think it's time for me to start contributing as well...
